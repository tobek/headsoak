// @NOTE: Adding a new file to one of these globbed folders, e.g. `components/foo.sass` won't register with webpack dev server (won't reload, page won't update with the styles) unless you restart webpack dev server OR make a change to this file that imports the glob.

// Major regions of the page - currently just header which may later be a component, so maybe unnecessary
@import 'layout/*.sass'

// Reusable parts like menus, form stuff, autocomplete...
@import 'parts/*.sass'

// "Components" in the Angular sense (Note, NoteBrowser, Tag, etc.)
@import 'components/*.sass'
